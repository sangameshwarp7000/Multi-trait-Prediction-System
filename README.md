### Description:
Multi-Trait Multi-Environment Genomic Prediction for End-use Quality Traits in Wheat

### Introduction:
The investigation set out to explore the efficacy of multi-trait genomic selection models in predicting critical end-use quality traits in soft white wheat. The scope of the research encompassed two locations, Pullman and Lind, over a substantial timeframe from 2015 to 2019. The primary aim was to evaluate whether utilizing multi-trait models could offer a significant advantage over traditional unitrait models in predicting these pivotal traits, and to investigate the potential amplification in predictive accuracy when genotype by environment interactions are incorporated. This ambitious undertaking sought to provide a thorough assessment, offering implications for advancing wheat breeding strategies and the utility of genomic selection in crop improvement
